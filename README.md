# EFFECT

Every moment of our lives is governed by the passage of time, and it impacts every action and decision we make. Time is involved in everything we do, from waking up and going to work to eating a meal, exercising, and socializing with friends and family. Our perception of time varies based on emotions and experiences, with moments of happiness and excitement appearing to pass quickly and dull or uncomfortable moments seemingly dragging on. To understand the importance of time, it is essential to recognize its role in achieving goals, success, and personal growth. Efficient time management helps us make the most of our limited hours and balance work, leisure, and self-improvement. Effective use of time is vital in maintaining our mental and physical well-being and overall life satisfaction.
